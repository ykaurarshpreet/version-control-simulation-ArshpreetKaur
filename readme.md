Reflection

    In order to create this project I created a Github repository. I signed into my Github account, added a new 
    repository and cloned it. I opened my VS Code IDE and opened my cloned repository and started a new terminal.
    Using Gitbash, I created branches in this project by typing "git checkout -b [Insert branch name]" and then 
    I would create my index.html file in which I added the boilerplate code to my html file. My first branch was 
    called feature/header, in which I had went to my index.html file and typed in the element header and wrote 
    some text in there. After making the changes in my branch, I would have to stage the changes by typing "git 
    add index.html"and then commit those changes by typing " git commit -m "[insert description of changes made]" 
    and then switch to my main branch. Then I created my second branch which was called feature/footer. I would 
    then go into this branch and essentially do the same thing as before, except I would type in a footer element 
    and then write some text. Regardless of what branch I was in, whenever I would make adjustments to the html 
    file I would make sure to stage and commit the changes I made. The two branches I create for this project were
    "feature/header" and "feature/footer." At some point I ran into a merge conflict, which is an issue that occurs 
    when two developers have to change the same lines in a file on different branch and the the Git system flags this 
    as a conflict. In order to resolve the merge conflict I went to the main and manually edited the html file to 
    include what I needed and removed what I did not need. Then I staged and commited the resolved changes. Finally I 
    used "git status" to ensure all conflicts were resolved.
